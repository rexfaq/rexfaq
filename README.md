### Hi there 👋

_A thousand or more questions on REX token answered by the community_ (in progress) https://rex-token.com/start

**1) What is the date of birth of Rex Token?**  

REX was deployed (and ownership renounced) on Binance Smart Chain on June 20, 2021.  

**2) How can I recover my “Club 5555” status?**  

By making another 5555 days stake with at least 100,000.00 Rex tokens.

**3) What are the benefits of “Club 5555” status?**  

As of today (09-2021), they have not been announced. But they are benefits, it’s better to have them than not.  

**4) Are the benefits of “Club 5555” status somehow related to how long you’ve been a 5555 days staker?**  

We are aware of this but haven’t made a decision yet. As of now, there is no answer!  

**5) Can a line of code written in the Rex smart contract on Binance Smart Chain ever be altered, in any sense?**  

No. Not a single line of Rex can be altered. Ever. The contract is set in stone and the keys to it are burnt.  

**6) Can Rex token and every other asset related to it be taken down, in any sense?**  

No. Rex is sitting on Binance Smart Chain and currently there are 21 independent validators working for the chain. You can also run a full private node to support it. Check https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/developer/fullnode.html.  

**7) Can second layer solutions be built on top of REX smart contracts?**  

Yes! As of now, none of them came from the same team that built REX.  

**8) Is a general interest rate based on the multiple stakes owned by the same wallet in the way?**  

Thomas, REX founder, gave a nod to this on the official Telegram channel. [https://t.me/eth_rex/85262](https://t.me/eth_rex/85262). It’s not yet available.

**9) Where can I revoke all my approved contracts on Metamask Wallet?**

https://app.unrekt.net/ (a more advanced version, but on beta, can be found here: https://v2.unrekt.net/).

**10) PCS goes for?**

https://pancakeswap.finance/

**11) What are private keys and how important they are?**

In crypto, your private keys are the most important thing in the world. They are the final and irrevocable proof that you own your tokens. If anyone has them, they can do anything with your tokens. Always write them down in a piece of paper and store it safely. In metamask they go for 12 (twelve) english random words.

**12) Is there an early days REX historical price and Market cap data?**

Yes. https://nomics.com/assets/rex2-rex/history

**13) Where can I buy BNB directly while in the US?**

You can buy it on the american partner of Binance: https://www.binance.us/en/home. 

**14) When I withdraw my BNB coming from Binance or Binance US what network (chain) should I select, "Binance Chain" or "Smart Chain"?**

Binance US does not have a withdrawal option for Smart Chain. Addresses from Binance chain (BEP) ALWAYS start with "bnb1" on it. Addresses from Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) ALWAYS start with "0x". Every transaction with REX smart contracts happens in Binance SMART Chain (BEP20). So in order to save on fees for swapping between chains you can always go for BEP20. 

**15) Are staked Rex tokens shown on any Market Cap site calculation?** 

No! This is a unique feature of Rex. When you stake all your Rex they are burnt. And only you can mint them back. You're not a "holder" of Rex anymore, you're in Ghost Mode. Privacy is one of the main features of this project and what sets it apart from other staking platforms. You can still see the total amount of Rex staked here: https://rex-token.com/dash. Check the founder's specific comment on this feature here: https://t.me/eth_rex/54702

**16) When did REX ecosystem hit the trading volume of 1M USD for the first time?**

According to nomics.com, on the 7th of Setember 2021. This means that one million dollars of "free" (unstaked) rex was traded for the first time, an important milestone for the project and the community. 

**17) Is there a rex-token.com backup website?**  

Yes! [https://internet-bonds.com/start](https://internet-bonds.com/start)

**18) Is there other reason to hold a MREX besides getting a referral bonus?**

Yes. A wallet holding a MREX enables the SCRAPE function of a stake. This means you can scrape your interest earlier than what your timelock allows you to do so without penalty. It allows you to rename your stake also, and this name is a transaction. It's useful to get information about your stake five, six years later. Finally, there are only 10.000 MREX available in the whole world. And this quantity will never change, since the contract is immutable. MREX could go up in value for the same reason. 

**19) Does holding more MREX makes me receive more % of bnb from the auctions ?**

No. Only for referals reward. 1MREX = 4% BNB reward. 20 MREX = 6% BNB reward. So the amount varies from 4% to 6%. 

**20) Can someone win BPD multiple times?**

Yes, up until the end of the auction. After, only wallets that didn't win become eligible for the BNB treasury that works in a similar way for BPDs. 

**21) BPD goes for?**

Big pay days. 

**22) Does BPD appears on the dashboard only if win? And If I don’t claim by the time the next auction starts do I lose it?**

Yes.
No. 

**23) How do I achieve ULTRA REXICAN status?**

By accumulating 25 bnb or more via referal rewards. In order to receive BNB for referal rewards (plus REX) your wallet needs to hold atleast one MREX. 


**24) Does it makes sense that in one BPD day all wallets being rewarded are new wallets and in another day all of them are old wallets?**

The first address is drawn randomly, then it's given out sequentially. This is the most efficient way to do it on the blockchain as Thomas has explained a long time ago. So all new wallets just means the first one picked is very new. Courtesy of @homuraaaaaa: https://t.me/c/1443915360/10209

**25) "It’s to my understanding that if you scrape interest, it lowers your over all shares as well. Does it lower it to the current share rate at the time of the scrape?"**

Any scraped interest that goes above the amount of your principal DESTROYS your interest rate, permanently. So any 100% plus interest scrape will make your stake a 0% interest stake afterwards. The shares are dilluted in benefit of all other stakes. 

**26) Why do we need Mrex to scrape the interest ? How much do we need it ?**

Part of REX project game theory and tokenomics comes from MREX and TREX features. Think of them like perks works in a game. Since day zero to eternity, there will be only 10.000 MREX and 1000 TREX, so they are scarce and valuable. This is because their features accelerates your earnings, overall. Since scrape is a feature that needs some kind of control, otherwise a stake (with a timelock) wouldn't make sense, MREX is needed to enable it. You just need one MREX to enable scraping. 

**27) If I create a 5555 stake while I hold my TREX to get maximum interest, then transfer that stake to a friend, who doesn't have a TREX, will the interest rate go down when they receive the stake?**

No. TREX staked stakes are transferable! And they don't lose their perk when you transfer them. 

**28) AXION and WISE are failed clones of HEX. How is REX better than these other projects?**

10 testnets phases before mainnet, tons of simulations for economic sustanability attainment. Teams made of software engineers, economists, computer scientists, crypto old timers and so forth. 

**29) If I move one of my stakes to another account will this reduce my stake % for bpd?**

The example in the whitepaper says that "if an address has sent 2 BNB to auction, then claimed 50,000 REX, then staked those 50,000 REX (=100%) and is then hit by random generator, it gets 100% of 2 BNB as reward". It is safe to conclude that moving stakes diminishes your BPD premium. 

**30) Hello all first time here, and i am about to make my first stake, but i want to ask a question about the Mrex, I read in the white paper that it allows you scrape early, but the question is does it get burned or do i lose when i scrape early or i can do more scrapes with 1 Mrex ?""

MREX token is not consumable! As long as you hold one, you can use its perks permanently. 

**31) if i just staked 4 hours ago I can still unstake my whole stash to restake it right?**

Yes! The option "close" will be available in the first 24 hours of your stake if you want to give up on it. 

**32) Is BPD on dashboard? If you don’t claim by the time the next auction starts do you lose it?**

It will only appear in your dashboard if you won it! No, you don't lose unclaimed BPDs. They accumulate. 

**33) Hi, it is stated that if you have 100k rex staked, you will be a member  of Club 5555. I have 102k, but I am not in the club. Anyone knows why?**

5555 club means that you own more than 100k rex staked PLUS a 5555 days stake (maximum period). In that case you don't have a 5555 days period stake. 

**34) If get a TrEX now will it affect my stakes that are already made?**

No. Only stakes made with a TREX in the same wallet will get the perk. 

**35) What is the current daily interest % for TREX stakes, as in today (09.20.21)?**

13.30%

**36) That’s crazy, every BPD won came from a new wallet! That’s good but, does that mean it’s not random? Isn't it supposed to be random? Lol.**
