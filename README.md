### Hi there 👋

**1) Is there a rex-token.com backup website?**  

Yes! [https://internet-bonds.com/start](https://internet-bonds.com/start)

 **2) How can I recover my “Club 5555” status?**  

By making another 5555 days stake with at least 100,000.00 Rex tokens.  

**3) What are the benefits of “Club 5555” status?**  

As of today (09-2021), they have not been announced. But they are benefits, it’s better to have them than not.  

**4) Are the benefits of “Club 5555” status somehow related to how long you’ve been a 5555 days staker?**  

We are aware of this but haven’t made a decision yet. As of now, there is no answer!  

**5) Can a line of code written in the Rex smart contract on Binance Smart Chain ever be altered, in any sense?**  

No. Not a single line of Rex can be altered. Ever. The contract is set in stone and the keys to it are burnt.  

**6) Can Rex token and every other asset related to it be taken down, in any sense?**  

No. Rex is sitting on Binance Smart Chain and currently there are thousands of independent full nodes running the chain.  

 **7) What is the date of birth of Rex Token?**  

REX was deployed (and ownership renounced) on Binance Smart Chain on June 20, 2021.  

**8) Can second layer solutions be built on top of REX smart contracts?**  

Yes! As of now, none of them came from the same team that built REX.  

**9) Will multiple stakes owned by the same wallet lead to more interest?**  

Thomas, REX founder, gave a nod to this on the official Telegram channel. [https://t.me/eth_rex/85262](https://t.me/eth_rex/85262). It’s not yet avaiable.

**10) Where can I revoke all my approved contracts on Metamask Wallet?**

https://app.unrekt.net/ (a more advanced version, but on beta, can be found here: https://v2.unrekt.net/).

**11) PCS goes for?**

https://pancakeswap.finance/

**12) What are private keys and how important they are?**

In crypto, your private keys are the most important thing in the world. They are the final and irrevocable proof that you own your tokens. If anyone has them, they can do anything with your tokens. Always write them down in a piece of paper and store it safely. In metamask they go for 12 (twelve) english random words.

**13) Is there an early days REX historical data?**

Yes. https://nomics.com/assets/rex2-rex/history
