### Hi there 👋

_A thousand or more questions on REX token answered by the community_ (in progress) https://rex-token.com/start

THIS FAQ IS BEING UPDATED FOR REX 2.0

Due to a smartcontract vulnerability that allowed investors to continuosly scrape their interest with the "scrape" function, Rex is being redeployed on (the same) blockchain, Binance Smart Chain. 

The ETA is January 2022.  

**1) What is the date of birth of Rex Token?**  

REX was deployed (and ownership renounced) on Binance Smart Chain on June 20, 2021.

**2) When REX 2.0 is set to be deployed, its ownership renounced and its liquidity added?**

According to the latest AMA, Rex 2.0 deployment is depending on all its codes audits. They are happening as of this date (12.14.2021) and there are indications that everything could be set to launch until middle to end of January 2022. 

**3) Where can I find all the frequent AMAs that are being held by the devs of Rex?**

You can find them pinned on the telegram official group: https://t.me/newrextoken. Please be careful with any information published elsewhere. 

                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           
                                                           The 5555 status and its perks 

**2) How can I recover my “Club 5555” status?**  

By making another 5555 days stake with at least 100,000.00 Rex tokens.

**3) What are the benefits of “Club 5555” status?**  

As of today (09-2021), they have not been announced. But they are benefits, it’s better to have them than not.  

**4) Are the benefits of “Club 5555” status somehow related to how long you’ve been a 5555 days staker?**  

We are aware of this but haven’t made a decision yet. As of now, there is no answer!  

**5) Can a line of code written in the Rex smart contract on Binance Smart Chain ever be altered, in any sense?**  

No. Not a single line of Rex can be altered. Ever. The contract is set in stone and the keys to it are burnt.  

**7) Can second layer solutions be built on top of REX smart contracts?**  

Yes! As of now, none of them came from the same team that built REX.  

**8) Is a general interest rate based on the multiple stakes owned by the same wallet in the way?**  

Thomas, REX founder, gave a nod to this on the official Telegram channel. [https://t.me/eth_rex/85262](https://t.me/eth_rex/85262). It’s not yet available.

**9) Where can I revoke all my approved contracts on Metamask Wallet?**

https://app.unrekt.net/ (a more advanced version, but on beta, can be found here: https://v2.unrekt.net/).

**10) PCS goes for?**

https://pancakeswap.finance/

**11) What are private keys and how important they are?**

In crypto, your private keys are the most important thing in the world. They are the final and irrevocable proof that you own your tokens. If anyone has them, they can do anything with your tokens. Always write them down in a piece of paper and store it safely. In metamask they go for 12 (twelve) english random words.

**12) Is there an early days REX historical price and Market cap data?**

Yes. https://nomics.com/assets/rex2-rex/history

**13) Where can I buy BNB directly while in the US?**

You can buy it on the american partner of Binance: https://www.binance.us/en/home. 

**14) When I withdraw my BNB coming from Binance or Binance US what network (chain) should I select, "Binance Chain" or "Smart Chain"?**

Binance US does not have a withdrawal option for Smart Chain. Addresses from Binance chain (BEP) ALWAYS start with "bnb1" on it. Addresses from Binance Smart Chain (BEP20) ALWAYS start with "0x". Every transaction with REX smart contracts happens in Binance SMART Chain (BEP20). So in order to save on fees for swapping between chains you can always go for BEP20. 

**15) Are staked Rex tokens shown on any Market Cap site calculation?** 

No! This is a unique feature of Rex. When you stake all your Rex they are burnt. And only you can mint them back. You're not a "holder" of Rex anymore, you're in Ghost Mode. Privacy is one of the main features of this project and what sets it apart from other staking platforms. You can still see the total amount of Rex staked here: https://rex-token.com/dash. Check the founder's specific comment on this feature here: https://t.me/eth_rex/54702

**16) When did REX ecosystem hit the trading volume of 1M USD for the first time?**

According to nomics.com, on the 7th of Setember 2021. This means that one million dollars of "free" (unstaked) rex was traded for the first time, an important milestone for the project and the community. 

**18) Will MREX perks continue in Rex 2.0?**

Yes. You can check all important information about MREX in this answer. A wallet holding a MREX enables the SCRAPE function of a stake. This means you can scrape your interest earlier than what your timelock allows you to do so without penalty. It allows you to rename your stake also, and this name is a transaction. It's useful to get information about your stake five, six years later. Finally, there are only 10.000 MREX available in the whole world. And this quantity will never change, since the contract is immutable. MREX could go up in value for the same reason. You can still buy MREX as in today. Here is the contract address: https://bscscan.com/token/0x76837D56D1105bb493CDDbEFeDDf136e7c34f0c4. The last MREX traded went for ~70 USD and it can be bought on pancakeswap.finance by adding the contract address (just the string) on one of the sections in exchange section. 

**19) Why do we need Mrex to scrape the interest? How much do we need it?**

Part of REX project game theory and tokenomics comes from MREX and TREX features. Think of them like perks works in a game. Since day zero to eternity, there will be only 10.000 MREX and 1000 TREX, so they are scarce and valuable. This is because their features accelerates your earnings, overall. Since scrape is a feature that needs some kind of control, otherwise a stake (with a timelock) wouldn't make sense, MREX is needed to enable it. You just need one MREX to enable scraping.

**25) "It’s to my understanding that if you scrape interest, it lowers your over all shares as well. Does it lower it to the current share rate at the time of the scrape?"**

Any scraped interest that goes above the amount of your principal DESTROYS your interest rate, permanently. So any 100% plus interest scrape will make your stake a 0% interest stake afterwards. The shares are dilluted in benefit of all other stakes. 

**26) Why do we need Mrex to scrape the interest? How much do we need it?**

Part of REX project game theory and tokenomics comes from MREX and TREX features. Think of them like perks works in a game. Since day zero to eternity, there will be only 10.000 MREX and 1000 TREX, so they are scarce and valuable. This is because their features accelerates your earnings, overall.

**27) If I create a 5555 stake while I hold my TREX to get maximum interest, then transfer that stake to a friend, who doesn't have a TREX, will the interest rate go down when they receive the stake?**

No. TREX staked stakes are transferable! And they don't lose their perk when you transfer them. 

**28) AXION and WISE are failed clones of HEX. How is REX better than these other projects?**

10 testnets phases before mainnet, tons of simulations for economic sustanability attainment. Teams made of software engineers, economists, computer scientists, crypto old timers and so forth. 

**29) If I move one of my stakes to another account will this reduce my stake % for bpd?**

The example in the whitepaper says that "if an address has sent 2 BNB to auction, then claimed 50,000 REX, then staked those 50,000 REX (=100%) and is then hit by random generator, it gets 100% of 2 BNB as reward". It is safe to conclude that moving stakes diminishes your BPD premium. 

**30) Hello all first time here, and i am about to make my first stake, but i want to ask a question about the Mrex, I read in the white paper that it allows you scrape early, but the question is does it get burned or do i lose when i scrape early or i can do more scrapes with 1 Mrex ?""**

MREX token is not consumable! As long as you hold one, you can use its perks permanently. 

**31) if i just staked 4 hours ago I can still unstake my whole stash to restake it right?**

Yes! The option "close" will be available in the first 24 hours of your stake if you want to give up on it. 

**32) Is BPD on dashboard? If you don’t claim by the time the next auction starts do you lose it?**

It will only appear in your dashboard if you won it! No, you don't lose unclaimed BPDs. They accumulate. 

**33) Hi, it is stated that if you have 100k rex staked, you will be a member  of Club 5555. I have 102k, but I am not in the club. Anyone knows why?**

5555 club means that you own more than 100k rex staked PLUS a 5555 days stake (maximum period). In that case you don't have a 5555 days period stake. 

**34) If get a TrEX now will it affect my stakes that are already made?**

No. Only stakes made with a TREX in the same wallet will get the perk. 

**35) What is the current daily interest % for TREX stakes, as in today (09.20.21)?**

13.30%

**36) That’s crazy, every BPD won came from a new wallet! That’s good but, does that mean it’s not random? Isn't it supposed to be random? Lol.**

Please check answer (24) of this FAQ. 

**37) Without Trex, what are the benefits of a 5555 days stake?**

5555 status, 7x multiplier on your number of shares, 0,X% something interest daily, as of today, and token apreciation. Also consider the fact that after 7.5 years you can finish your stake without any penalty. It's up to you. 

**38) Will REX project develop a DEX (Descentralized exchange) for selling stakes, perking stakes with TREX and MREX and so forth?**

Check the dev answer to this there: https://t.me/eth_rex/106978. As of today, this is all we know so far about it. 

**39) How is TREX apreciation going?** 

Very very strong right now. Here is a deterministic pancakeswap chart price estimation (Courtesy of @xqzi from TG group https://t.me/eth_rex/111056): 

At 16 TREX = 7941.18 BUSD/TREX

At 15 TREX = 9000.00 BUSD/TREX

At 14 TREX = 10285.71 BUSD/TREX

At 13 TREX = 11868.13 BUSD/TREX

At 12 TREX = 13846.15 BUSD/TREX

At 11 TREX = 16363.64 BUSD/TREX

At 10 TREX = 19636.36 BUSD/TREX

At 9 TREX = 24000.00 BUSD/TREX

At 8 TREX = 30000.00 BUSD/TREX

At 7 TREX = 38571.43 BUSD/TREX

At 6 TREX = 51428.57 BUSD/TREX

At 5 TREX = 72000.00 BUSD/TREX

At 4 TREX = 108000.00 BUSD/TREX

At 3 TREX = 180000.00 BUSD/TREX

At 2 TREX = 360000.00 BUSD/TREX

At 1 TREX = 1080000.00 BUSD/TREX

**38) Will the benefits of a TREX ever disappear? Is it time limited in some way?**

No and no. What will disappear (decrease) is the % of interest you get, since many TREX stakes are being made on a daily basis, and this lowers the % for every other stakes. 

**39) Can binance due to some crypto regulations cann the coin?**

This is a very unusual question about Rex. Binance is not a regulator, it's a crypto exchange. The only thing Binance can do is not list Rex as one of their trading crypto assets. This won't harm Rex at all, if we take into account Hex historical precification. It never needed a single exchange to succeed, it doesn't depend on that. 

**40)How long is the revoke stake available without penalty after putting a stake? 1 day?**

Yes. 

**41) What happens when you break a stake?**

You can either split it or revoke it. It's a contract! You made a commitment. It's written in stone since it's a smart contract. And immutable. So the penalty is from 100% of your principal to 0% calculated from day 1 to seven and a half years (when maximum staking 5555 days). If it's a 30 days stake, then it's 15 days until it has no penalty. 

**42) Will I make to BPD? I have participated in 3 auctions - all with 5 bnb each + 20 mrex owned?**

The chances are very high. That's because as in today (09/22/2021), you still have 271 days to be selected, and if you don't, you end up being eligible for the treasury. Check "BNB treasury" on Rex website. You can always create more wallets and make them eligible for BPD also. 

**43) Hi question can you lend someone the mrex for scraping then have it return to you? Does it affect your account in any way?**

Yes, you can! And no, it doesn't affect it in any way. 

**44) If we reach principal amount of REX in interest then its better if we not revoke it coz then our share will be lost completely ? Am I right?**

Yes, at the same time it makes no sense to revoke a stake with its interest so high. The best thing to do it to scrape it. For that you need a MREX. 

**45) Why do you believe Mrex to be more valuable?**

Community did some colective reflection on MREX valuation in comparison to TREX. In the long run, interests rates will significantly decrease (devs. mentioned from 40 to 60% APY, in Hex it's 40%). So it can get to a point where MREX functionality turns out to be more valuable then TREX one. All of this is speculation, but the rationale behind  is interesting. 

**46) Guys if i buy 0,1 bnb Rex per day i can drop on the same stake ?**

No, you can't add up REX on a stake that has already been made. 

**47) What is a Dead Stake?**

It's a stake that got its interest (above 100%) fully scraped. And now can never produce interest again.

**48) So the MRex lets me scrape the principal not interest??? I thought you scraped interest first.**

You scrape interest only. You never scrape the principal. The principal you can only access through closing the stake. 

**49) My earning not active yet, can I close stake?**

If it's day -1 yes, if theres the option to revoke appearing to you, yes. If it's day 0 already then you can't close it without a huge penalty. 

**50) Guys, trying to send BNB through the auction but doesn’t work. Anything wrong?**

This is being worked out. But most of the time is due to the fact that the referral address that you're using is already being used for the same auction day. Just randomize more the referral or get one that you know that hasn't been used. MREX holders can be referrals without a limit. 

**51) Anyone knows why Rex been dumping like that? This weekend I was a little off. (09.26.2021)**

Well, whales are liquidating their Rex. This will happen a lot and there isn't much to do about it. It happens in every project. The biggest holders detain a certain power over the price, but this tends to deconcentrate in the long run. 

**52) When does Rex get a CEX (Centralized Exchange) listing?**

Rex design is not very compatible with CEX listings. It's simply not connected to that type of trade and market. Why? Because it's a financial product, a form of investment, a Certificate of Deposit. It would be strange to trade investments in a Centralized Exchanges. Imagine you are trading a contract. It doesn't make sense. The same applies to Hex, while being one of the first investment-only token at 2 years old it hasn't been listed yet. And maybe it never will. Simply because the token use case is not trade, but investment. 

**53) "Some of you dont understand that this what made APY that high today was whales unstaking their big bags. There was (and hopefully stays like this) over 400000000 tokens circulating. Yes, closing dead stakes contribute to APY increase but not big fat 2% that we've seen today (in reference to the Dead Stakes event 09/24/21)). Let's hope whale(s) dont restake for some period and keep apy close to 15-16%."**

This is a double edged sword. Like anything in tokenomics there are incentives and counter incentives to balance the game theory behind Rex. While whales scrape and sell REX, they do raise the interest % for everyone. At the same time they dump the price so it could lead to things being equal. People are attracted to both price apreciation and APY. This is why MASS ADOPTION is the overarching aim of Rex project. It simply solves everything in a win-win scenario to all participants. This of course comes with a price, rewards will be decreased for huge players and will get more and more distributed. 

**54) Hey guys I’ve got two questions: when you close dead stakes is that the same as essentially burning those tokens? As in your principal that was staked?**

No. The tokens aren't burnt. They are distributed in the form of shares among all stakeholders in a form of penalty for withdrawing the stake before its maturing period (that was defined in its birth). You can check formulas for penalty and share distribution in the White Paper.
